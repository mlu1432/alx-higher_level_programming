## JavaScript - Advanced and Object-Oriented Programming

This repository contains a collection of JavaScript scripts, each demonstrating different concepts and techniques in JavaScript programming, ranging from object-oriented programming to complex data manipulations. The scripts are part of an educational module designed to deepen understanding of JavaScript's capabilities and syntactical nuances.

## Scripts and Descriptions

### Rectangle Classes
- **0-rectangle.js**: An empty class `Rectangle` that defines a rectangle.
- **1-rectangle.js**: A class `Rectangle` that initializes an instance with `width` and `height` attributes.
- **2-rectangle.js**: Enhances the `Rectangle` class to handle width and height validation.
- **3-rectangle.js**: Extends the `Rectangle` class with a method to print the rectangle using the character `X`.
- **4-rectangle.js**: Adds rotate and double methods to the `Rectangle` class to modify dimensions.
- **5-square.js**: A class `Square` that inherits from `Rectangle` and includes a constructor for size.
- **6-square.js**: Extends the `Square` class from `5-square.js` with a `charPrint(c)` method to print the square using a given character.
  
### Functionality Scripts
- **7-occurrences.js**: A function that returns the number of occurrences of an element in a list.
- **8-esrever.js**: A function that returns the reversed version of a list.
- **9-logme.js**: A function that prints the number of arguments already printed and the new argument value.

### Advanced Data Handling
- **10-converter.js**: A function that converts a number from base 10 to another base passed as argument.
- **100-map.js**: Script that imports a list and computes a new list with each value multiplied by its index using `Array.map()`.
- **101-sorted.js**: Script that imports a dictionary of occurrences by user id and computes a dictionary of user ids by occurrence.
- **102-concat.js**: Script that concats 2 files into a third one, demonstrating file I/O operations.
